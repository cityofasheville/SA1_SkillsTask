City of Asheville Time Off Accruals
=====

##The Problem
Like any large organization, the City of Asheville  needs to track time off accruals for the approximately 1100 employees that work for the city. This includes vacation time, sick leave, and compensatory time (aka Comp time) for both exempt and non-exempt employees. These accruals represent a liability for the organization and managers need to track comp time in particular to make sure that large numbers of comp hours are not accrued by individual employees. In particular, if an employee has more than 40 hours of accrued comp time, it should be flagged for review.

The goal of this exercise is to analyze accrual data (see below) and deliver that analysis and any related visualizations. Part of the solution should allow a division manager or department director to review accrual balances for their employees. Additional insights aor visualizations are welcome.

Once the data are organized to provide meaningful metrics/visualizations, we will need to monitor accruals on an ongoing basis. Ideally, each manager or department director could easily review accrual balances with a live data feed that is constantly updated.

##Data

* Employee Time Off Accrual Data can all be found here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-uuat4PtUk1VmwyTGdBb29xaEE&usp=sharing
* Files include the following tables:
1. Employee Master - employee data
